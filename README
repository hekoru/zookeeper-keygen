A ver simple sequential key generator using zookeeper. Ids are requested in blocks of configurable size to minimize
contention. Sinchronization is achieved using the keygen node version id. A client will try to update the id counter
using the last version id known to it, and if it failed, it will get the new counter version and try again.

This can cause contention on multiple clients, but it is mitigated because it's strange for all the clients to run out
of keys at the same time.

Keys assigned to a node are not recoverable and lost if the client jvm is shutdown.
